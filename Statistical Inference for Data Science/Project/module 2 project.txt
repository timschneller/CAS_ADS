regression/tests/multiple tests... just apply the things we learned

idea: 

prepare dataset from SAR with STATA.
inclusion/exclusion criteria to have groups that are similar.

introduction: explain: what is an endoprosthesis, reverse vs. anatomic, lateralization, abduction

method: where is the data from, how is it measured, exclusion/inclusion, statistical method.

hypothesis: 

compare lateralization vs no lateralization of reverse shoulder prosthesis on outcome (abduction strength,rom,cs,ssv) 2 years after surgery.
grouping by: diagnosis, Chief surgeon yes or no, male/female, ASA category, bmi, overhead sports

group comparison std. diff.?

regression: strenght = intercept + abd_strength baseline + lateralization + chief y/n + age + asa + bmi + overhead + 

limitations: physical therapy not known, records with missing data are dropped -> biased maybe? baseline comparison missign, are groups the same/comparable?
plots: strength baseline/2years


0) background: schulterprothese, glenoid, scapula, humerus. inverse prothese. vorteil zu anatomisch: medialisiertes gelenkzentrum und grössere vorspannung auf deltamuskel

explain ASA categories 

1) look at data from registry: take all reverse prostheses with outcome at 2 years. only primär implantations

groups with lateralized + 6mm had only 3 complete datasets. -> merge with lateralized +  3mm

patients with already high baseline score didnt improve as much?

outcomes csc, abdc, ssvc
lateralized vs not lateralized
male vs female
bmi25+ vs bmi25- (maybe 30+/30-) begleiterkrankungen..?
asa34 vs asa12
Prim.OA vs CTA
